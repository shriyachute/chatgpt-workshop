The GPT-generated program will print a reminder for when the stand up meeting starts
as well as schedules a stand up meeting. 

One issue is regarding the meeting_time variable, which has to be reset almost everytime the program is ran. Currently, it has to be set one minute ahead of when you run it, 
at which point it then runs after compiling. This could be fixed by using a Date object that finds the exact time, so that the program will run immediately without constant changes required.

Team members are also set in a predefined list. This would need to be fixed such that new team members can be added and removed. 

Overall, the bot seems to handle scheduling tasks well, but further integration with team calendars and updating team members would definitely be useful.
